                   padding:20px; text-align:center;  " placeholder="SAVE EIA" type="text" name="This is with reference to the draft EIA notification, 2020 which has been uploaded on the website of the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climatic Change on 12.3.2020 seeking public comments.

We are very much worried that this draft is placed before the people and they are asked to give comments in the midst of a national health crisis when the public life is severely disrupted. This gives us an impression that the Ministry found the pandemic an opportunity to slip away with the contentious draft evading proper analysis and discussion among the people. We feel that it is vital to preserve healthy consultation with the people in a healthy democracy, where as the manner in which the present draft is pushed through renders the process of consultation a mere mockery. Therefore we demand to call off the process and defer it to a time when normalcy is restored and the people will be more equipped to discuss on various proposals in the draft in detail and give their valuable inputs.

Going into the details of the present EIA draft it becomes clear that the draft is based on a mindset that environmental regulations are unnecessary hindrances to the developmental activities. The Idea that impact on environment due to human actions is to be subjected to public regulation is founded on a strong conviction that environmental rights are firmly linked to human rights and each generation is obliged to secure the future generations. The ministry and governing machinery acting as mouthpiece of corporate interests is unfortunate.

Many of the activities which are included in category B2, expressly exempted from requirement of EIA, are subjects of serious concerns with regard to impacts of land-use change, water extraction, tree felling, pollution, waste and effluent management. This cannot be justified with any logic of environment protection.

The proposed provision for the post-facto environmental clearance of projects executed without prior clearance defeats the very purpose of environmental clearance. The post facto approval and regularisation of violations amounts to compromising environmental considerations with some penalty and is highly outrageous.

The requirements of submitting compliance reports by the project proponents two times a year has been proposed to be reduced to one. This casts serious doubts as to whose interests MoEF is serving, especially when the CAG found in 2016 significant deficiencies in semi-annual compliance reporting. As a public entity the ministry ought to have strengthened the system rather than to legalize breach and negligence.

It is understandable that many of the proposals in the draft have a direct bearing on the living and working conditions of people and the ecology. Such recommendations must be given an opportunity to be properly discussed among the people and their concerns to be suitably addressed rather than to push through amidst the pandemic.

We demand the government to withdraw the proposed controversial and anti-environmental EIA Draft-2020. We also appeal to the government that, make the draft immediately available in all languages of the VIII Schedule of the constitution so as to ensure informed public discussions across the country." size="50"><br><br>
